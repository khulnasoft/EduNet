## Discovered Defects (Fixed)

1. **UI package tsconfig missing path mapping** - Fixed by adding paths for `@edunet/ui/lib/utils`

3. **API client type errors** - Fixed unknown type handling
4. **Test files using require()** - Fixed to use proper imports
5. **Testing package lint error** - Fixed require statement
