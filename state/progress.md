# EduNet Progress Tracker

> **Superseded.** The per-phase checklist below was written by an earlier agent
> and overstated completion. In particular "tests" never ran (the suite invoked
> an uninstalled `jest` binary) and no database migration existed. Authoritative,
> evidence-based status lives in:
>
> - `docs/EDUNET-IMPLEMENTATION-STATE.md` — verified gates, defects fixed
> - `docs/EDUNET-ROADMAP-GAP-MATRIX.md` — per-workstream gap status
> - `docs/PRODUCTION_VERIFICATION.md` — original findings, corrected status
